## Overview
StockaDoodle is an inventory management system designed for **QuickMart Convenience Stores** in order to facilitate the management of daily operations of each branches. Each branch operates its own independent server, ensuring that all data—such as product inventory, sales, and user activities—is stored locally on each branch’s server. This decentralized setup allows Admins, Managers, and Retailers to carry out their respective duties within their branch, all in a secure and easy-to-use environment. Admins manage user accounts and system settings, Managers deal with stock monitoring and reporting, and Retailers use the Point-of-Sale (POS) module to record sales.
